## Potential Issues When Upgrading to Python 3.10

- **Hyperopt (v0.1.2):** This is an older version that might not be compatible with Python 3.10. Consider upgrading to a newer version.
- **MLflow:** Compatibility beyond version 1.30.0 needs verification. Test with Python 3.10 before full deployment.
- **Ruamel.yaml:** The specific version constraint may cause issues; updating or testing for compatibility is recommended.
- **Pymongo (v3.7.2):** This is quite old, and upgrading to a newer version is advised for Python 3.10 compatibility.
- **Protobuf:** The current constraint applies to Python 3.8 and below, so you will need to use a newer version for Python 3.10.

## Conclusion

While most dependencies should work with Python 3.10, there are a few that might cause issues, such as `hyperopt`, `mlflow`, `ruamel.yaml`, `pymongo`, and `protobuf`. Before upgrading to Python 3.10, you would need to:

1. **Upgrade** these problematic dependencies to versions that are confirmed to work with Python 3.10.
2. **Test** the entire environment thoroughly to ensure no compatibility issues arise during runtime.

If you decide to proceed with the upgrade, it may require some adjustments and thorough testing to ensure everything works as expected.
